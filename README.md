# ESP32-Audio-on-movement

Play audio when movement is detected.

Parts:
- ESP32
- HC-SR04
- HW-195
- MicroSD
- 18650 Battery +  Battery shield
- Relay
- Loudspeaker

Note:
The HW-195 allows for pause/play and other controls. However, since the audio starts playing from the beginning on powerup, I simply cut the power of the mp3 player with a relay.
